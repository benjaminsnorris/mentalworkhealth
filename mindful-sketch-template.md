In 2018, I discovered the world of mental health as I started having panic attacks, met with a therapist for the first time, and learned that I have severe OCD. Since then, I have been on a journey of recovery, healing, outreach, and advocacy. Now, I [write regularly](https://bennorris.com/mental-work-health/) about mental health, especially in the context of the workplace.

[Sketchnotes](https://rohdesign.com/sketchnotes/) are a form of visual note-taking that combines simple sketches with traditional notes in a more enjoyable process with a more engaging output. I have enjoyed capturing and [sharing sketchnotes](https://bennorris.com/tags/sketchnotes/), as well as teaching people how to get started, for over a decade.

The Mindful Sketch Template came out of a desire to combine these two worlds. Many people, such as myself, would like to engage in mindfulness practices like meditation, but find it difficult. Engaging more of your body in an active way can help quiet and focus your mind.

I drew a version of this template and started using it myself, iterating and adapting over a few months. As I settled in to a daily practice, I found the prompts helpful to guide my self-reflection. I hope that it will be as beneficial to you as it has to me.
