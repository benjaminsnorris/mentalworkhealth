I loved this article from the Art of Manliness: [Sunday Firesides: I Have Kids](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-i-have-kids/).

> Then one day, for reasons unknown, I suddenly saw the open printer drawer not as an impertinent annoyance, but as the inescapable evidence of a simple fact: I have kids.Â  Â 
> 
> I have kids, and kids inevitably come with some vexations. Yet theyâ€™re exactly what I want in my life, and a source of inexpressible joy. Because I have this privilege . . . I also have to accept its aggravations.

This is such an easy thing to forget and so important to remember. Our lives are not meant to be blissful, they are meant to be meaningful.
