After another challenging week, I share **a positive spike**, taking my kids and **winning the organ**, and the **return of sudoku**.

_These [weekly updates](https://bennorris.com/tags/weekly-update/) share life with [OCD](https://bennorris.com/tags/ocd/) as part of my [Mental Work Health](https://bennorris.com/mental-work-health/) project to reduce stigma around mental health, especially at work._

## Something hard

### [A positive spike](https://bennorris.com/2022/10/18/a-positive-spike)

> Almost immediately after starting the Prozac again, I started feeling so much better. Intellectually, I knew that it wasn‚Äôt actually the medication yet‚Äîthis one takes a bit to build up in my system before it really does anything. But my psychiatrist has talked with me about the value and importance of the placebo effect.
> 
> I think a lot of the benefit came from the hope that it instilled in me. Part of what I was excited about was the lack of uncertainty. I knew much more of what to expect, and could more or less plan on a return to being functional within a few weeks.
> 
> A couple days after the positive spike, I was back to spending half the day curled in my armchair, just trying to make it through the hour.

## Something good

### [Winning the organ](https://bennorris.com/2022/10/19/winning-the-organ)

> As a father, one of the hardest things for me is seeing my children suffer, particularly when it‚Äôs with distress that feels all too common. OCD, and mental illness in general, has a strong genetic component, so I am not surprised when I see some of my traits showing up in my kids.

## Something else

### [Return of sudoku](https://bennorris.com/2022/10/20/return-of-sudoku)

[![Sudoku screenshots](https://media.bennorris.com/images/mentalworkhealth/posts/sudoku-hint-screenshots.png){:loading="lazy"}](https://bennorris.com/2022/10/20/return-of-sudoku){:.clean}

> One of the activities that has helped me make it through the past couple weeks has been the excellent sudoku app, [Good Sudoku](https://www.playgoodsudoku.com/).

> One of the best things for me to keep me from tipping over into pure frustration is the *Hint* feature. If I feel stuck, I can get a hint and find the move that I hadn‚Äôt been able to see. I try to play hard enough puzzles that I typically need 1-3 hints.
> 
> So often, I wish that life had a *Hint* button. My OCD will often cause my brain to get stuck trying to understand something that someone said, and not allow me to move on. I wish that I could just get an alternate explanation without requiring the person to say things in the ‚Äúright‚Äù way so that I can process them more easily.

## Wrap up

I‚Äôve heard from a number of people who are also struggling right now. Life is hard! I hope that you can meet the challenges you are facing with grace and compassion for yourself.

The best *Hint* button I think I‚Äôve found for life is self-compassion. It unlocks so many things when you can allow yourself to just be and do without judgment or condemnation.
