I came upstairs and realized my hands were super cold. I put them under people’s shirts on their backs, and it was fascinating the different reactions.

7yo boy: Writhed and twisted to get away

6yo girl: No reaction

11yo boy: Yelped and jumped

12yo girl: Yelled and melted on the spot

Wife: An exclamation, “What is that? It’s cold!”

2yo boy: Reached back with his hands to move mine. Commented, “That’s cold!” Two minutes later, said, “Dad, that’s coldy!”

15yo girl: Turned and asked, “What are you doing? Go away!”
