I started the morning with a helpful exercise. Hoping to make this more of a practice.

***

*Mindful Sketch is an exercise that I developed to practice mindfulness by using sketchnotes. You can [view all mindfulsketch posts](/tags/mindfulsketch), [read more about it](/mindful-sketch-template/), or [buy the template](https://bennorris.shop/l/mindfulsketch) to support me and try the exercise yourself.*
