An exploration of a template I am creating for reviews of books I read.

***

In 2019, I have read 15 books. And yet, I have not shared any meaningful thoughts on those books. I recently finished *Keep Going*, by Austin Kleon, and [Patrick Rhone](https://patrickrhone.net/) asked my thoughts on it. I answered him, but realized I would have rather pointed him to a thoughtful review of the book. I want to push myself to be less passive, especially with content that I consume.

One help for creativity is to set limits. I wanted to create a template for book reviews, to give myself a few sections to complete. Having a template is a framework that I used previously in my daily journal entries. I haven‚Äôt done that for a while, but it seemed a great fit for books.

## Template

### Introduction/overview

*A short, untitled section with my overall thoughts on the book. Essentially a micropost.*

### Summary

*A synopsis of the plot or main points. Ideally spoiler-free.*

### Praise

*My favorite parts of the book, or areas I consider objective strengths.*

### Criticism

*At least one thing I think could be improved.*

### Quotes

*One or more of my favorite quotes pulled from the text.*

### Recommendation

*üëç or üëé, with a brief explanation.*

## Wrap-up

I have a hard time saying something negative about the creative output of another person. On the other hand, the feedback that I value the most about my own work is clear identification of opportunities for improvement. I am hoping that providing more nuance and context will allow me to think more critically of the books I read and form a more balanced perspective.

I would love to hear suggestions to improve my book review format. The main purpose of the reviews is to push me to think more about the content I consume, but I also hope that my thoughts can be helpful to others. If there are sections you would like to see added or omitted, let me know.
