Usually while driving I listen to podcasts, but for the past week or so, I’ve needed to hear classic rock. One song in particular has felt just right: [Crazy Train by Ozzy Osbourne](https://music.apple.com/us/album/crazy-train/1531535089?i=1531535287).

This section resonates:

[![Crazy train](https://media.bennorris.com/images/mentalworkhealth/uploads/2022/crazy-train.jpg)](https://music.apple.com/us/lyrics/1531535287?ts=233.826&te=252.201&l=en&tk=2.v1.lnNAg3yEq94pRXkh%2BBDsOg%3D%3D&itsct=sharing_msg_lyrics&itscg=50401)

OCD often feels unfair, and hearing someone yell about mental wounds is validating. It’s ironic to me, but often the thing that feels the best when I feel the worst is listening to angry music.
