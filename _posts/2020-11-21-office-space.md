One thing I am grateful for today is that I found a great small office space to rent to start getting a little more separation between work and home. Looking forward to getting set up and having somewhere to go for work. [#GiveThanks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/the-story-behind-my-global-prayer-of-gratitude)
