I loved this article this morning: [Sunday Firesides: Dependence to Independence - The Art of Manliness](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-dependence-to-independence/)

> Unfortunately, many people don’t outgrow this phase of infantile dependence. They still primarily try to get what they want by manipulating others, by having a “tantrum,” by metaphorically quivering their lip or pooping in their pants and then waiting for someone to notice. They wait for a solution to their problems to arrive from the outside.
> 
> Maturing means growing in your capability to meet your own needs, as you become progressively more skilled, competent, and emotionally intelligent. And it means becoming less needy in general. As Ralph Waldo Emerson put it, “Can anything be so elegant as to have few wants and to serve them oneself?”

I hope to improve this in my own life, and also to equip my children with these skills as they grow up.
