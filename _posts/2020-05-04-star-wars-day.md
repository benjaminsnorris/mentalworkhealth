We celebrated Star Wars day by all watching a movie. The older kids watched episode III upstairs for their first time. As the 7yo and 6yo and I watched Star Wars IV for the first time, they both climbed on to my lap as they got scared. The 7yo crawled over from his chair onto my lap. “Is this part scary? Well, just in case...”

The 6yo turned to me during the movie and said, “I just don’t know why. But I feel like I could just reach into the TV and hug Darth Vader. I don’t know why!”

After the movie, the 6yo was walking out and said, “Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I can’t believe that actually happened.”

Me: “Yeah.”

6yo: “Wait. Did it!? Did that really happen!?”
