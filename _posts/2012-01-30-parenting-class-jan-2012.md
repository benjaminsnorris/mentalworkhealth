The most challenging and difficult occupation today is that of parent. Similar to most jobs, you are expected to learn mostly through on-the-job training, except that the training part is a misnomer. You have no supervisor, no one checks your work, there are no performance reviews; in short, you are completely on your own. Of all the things that might be required in our education system, somehow these skills were left out.

I attended a parenting class taught by Kathy Andrizzi on January 27, 2012, and have been digesting it since. The class was based on the principles taught in *[The Power of Positive Parenting](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Positive-Parenting-Wonderful-Children/dp/1567131751)*, written by Kathy's uncle, Dr. Glenn Latham.

I captured the event with sketchnotes and am including them here.
