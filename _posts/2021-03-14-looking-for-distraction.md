<div class="trix-content">
  <div>I have taken off my phone most of the apps that are endless scrolling, mind-numbing distraction apps. However, I still find myself  getting out my phone and looking for distraction.<br><br>This time, when I caught myself, I decided I would write something instead. This is still a distraction of a sort, but a productive one. I always feel better after creating something, and often feel empty after mindlessly consuming.<br><br>It won’t always work to do a judo move on my brain and convert the distraction-seeking energy into motivation to produce, but I’m glad it did this time.</div>
