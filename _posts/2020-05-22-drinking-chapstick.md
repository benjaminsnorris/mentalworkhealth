My wife and our 2yo were reading a book and he found some new Burt’s Bees chapstick. My wife opened it for him and he put some on his lips and hers.

After she finished the book, he told her it was gone. She started looking around for it in the couch and asked him where it was.

Wife: “Is it on your face?”

He leaned in close and whispered, “I drinked it down.”
