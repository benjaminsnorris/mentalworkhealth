In the [most recent Jocko Underground podcast](https://micro.bennorris.com/2022/09/17/jocko-underground-pygmalion.html), Jocko answered a question of someone who was heartbroken. His answer was so perfect to me as the course to deal with my OCD, or with any strong and debilitating emotions.

The first step is to think of the emotions as waves. This perfectly matches the [dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy) skill of [“Ride the wave.”](https://dbtselfhelp.com/dbt-skills-list/emotion-regulation/ride-the-wave/)

Then, you have to stop thinking so much. Get out of your head and into your body.

One of the best ways to do that is Jocko’s favorite activity—[jiu jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu).

Finally, trust the process. These steps will take time, and you may not even see the progress initially. But they *will* pay off.
