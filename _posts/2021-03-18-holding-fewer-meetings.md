People at my work know that I am not a fan of meetings. I put together a presentation about communication principles and how we could have fewer meetings and be more productive.

Essentially, less of this:

And more of this:

We need to move away from group gatherings that often waste many people’s time, and embrace individual conversations and relationships.

I loved this article from Cal Newport: <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/03/18/combating-zoom-overload-with-reverse-meetings/">Combating zoom overload with reverse meetings</a>. Here is the basic premise:

<blockquote><ul><li>Everyone maintains regular office hours: set times each week during which they’re always available via video conference, chat, and phone. During these times you can digitally stop by and chat without a prior appointment. (For more on office hours, see <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90610764/completely-had-it-with-email-give-personal-personal-office-hours-a-try">this excerpt</a> from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525536558/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=stuhac-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0525536558&amp;linkId=b21bad29be593b14442630aa5d3e5612"><em>A World Without Email</em></a> on the topic.)</li><li>If you have a topic you want to discuss with a group of your colleagues, instead of gathering them all together in a new meeting, you instead visit each of their office hours one-by-one to talk it through.</li><li>In many cases, these one-on-one conversations should be sufficient for you to reach a resolution on the issue, or at the very least, reduce it down to a very targeted set of questions that can be much more efficiently addressed.</li></ul></blockquote>

There are so many things that we can and need to do in order to reduce the overwhelming number of meetings many of us participate in. This is a fantastic option.
