I feel incredibly grateful for a job today, and especially the one I have with [O.C. Tanner](https://www.octanner.com). As all jobs are, it is hard at times and pushes me to stretch and grow. I get to be with great people and focus on improving the lives of people at work. ðŸ¥° [#GiveThanks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/the-story-behind-my-global-prayer-of-gratitude)
