I believe that when we are vulnerable and expose our fragility, that act creates a safe space for others to do the same. To that end, the first series that I write will be to share my own experience discovering the world of mental health. As I have been more open about my journey, especially at work, I have found countless others who have had similar experiences but have kept them private. They are often glad for the chance to discuss their struggles in a safe environment. Hereâ€™s to increased awareness and decreased stigma!
