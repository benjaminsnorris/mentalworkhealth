This week‚Äôs update shares the story of learning a **magical word** that **unlocks my brain** and allows me to **do more of what I want**.

_These [weekly updates](https://bennorris.com/tags/weekly-update/) are an ongoing series in which I share what it is like to live with OCD in an effort to reduce the stigma around mental health, particularly in the workplace._

***

I [mentioned last week](https://bennorris.com/2022/03/26/playing-first-base) that my therapist began a session on a particularly difficult day by having me **listen to music**. This is something that we have done a number of times, and it has always been extremely helpful. After a recent session, she had assigned me as homework something funny to watch. When I texted her to report on how well it went, she was glad, but unsurprised.

> I think I might move into solely cinematic/musical/comedic therapy as a new treatment type. Nothing works better. (Plus add Jesus). Ha.

This week, I wanted to share the story of that funny video and how it has **transformed my life**.


## Story

To set the context for this story, I will go back to the end of January. Life was stressful for me as I was transitioning to my [new job](https://bennorris.com/2021/12/30/into-the-unknown). I had an experience that threw me completely off, and my therapist worked with me on the skill to recognize and share, ‚ÄúThis is what I can give‚Ä¶‚Äù I wrote about that in [update #67: What I can give](https://bennorris.com/2022/01/20/what-i-can-give).

Since that time, I have been working to try and be more **emotionally honest**, both with myself and with my wife.

As we got into February and March, my therapist said we needed to swing the pendulum almost to the other extreme for a little bit, and then come back to balance in the middle. We were talking about **plan changes** and how difficult it was for me to adjust to the needs and demands of the family when things inevitably went differently than anticipated.

When I would describe any situation in which I had to adjust, there was so much **overthinking**, and so much **resistance**. My therapist said I needed to just relax and do things without thinking about it.

She pulled up a Saturday Night Live clip of the character [**Chad**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_(Saturday_Night_Live)) for me to watch. She said **I needed to get to the point where I cared just as little as he**.

<p class="container" style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fF6gExZu-2M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

Now that I knew the character, she wanted me to watch another clip where he dies and meets his dad. As is stereotypically true, discussing **father issues** is a recurring and **painful** part of my therapy. Again, she wanted me to tap into how unconcerned Chad was about something that could have been monumental.

<p class="container" style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ivxx_grnL2c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

As I left therapy, my therapist said that she needed **a thousand ‚ÄúOk!‚Äùs** from me that week.

That evening on a date with my wife, I showed her the videos and we laughed about it. Part of what was funny was how unlike me Chad is. The idea that I could think or care so little about something was laughable.

But I tried.

The very next day, we had family plans in the evening, and I was going to need to leave early from work. My wife texted me that morning:

> And actually, I think we will need to leave here by four‚Ä¶ Can you be back by 3 instead?

I replied immediately with, ‚ÄúOk!‚Äù knowing she would hear it in Chad‚Äôs voice.

> ü§£
> 
> You‚Äôre great
> 
> And, that is an unprecedented response and it feels amazing on my end. Thanks. ü•∞

Later that day, she texted me about how things were going:

> We‚Äôre just going to have to pick up all the slack together probably after tonight üòÜü•¥

Again, I replied with ‚ÄúOk!‚Äù

> Oh my gosh this is amazing

I found it to be helpful even when I just caught **my brain getting stuck** on something. I went to turn on a show for the kids, and found that someone had rearranged the apps on my Apple TV. Immediately, irritation surged in me and I started to say something. But I caught myself, and said out loud, ‚ÄúOk!‚Äù

My wife was nearby and had witnessed the whole scene. She commented,

> Even if it only lasts a couple days, this has been completely worth it.

I found a video in which someone compiled every time Chad says, ‚ÄúOk!‚Äù and I have been **watching it almost daily**.

<p class="container" style="position:relative;overflow:hidden;width:100%;padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oJ9AvIIJTrY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

As I shared the success of this practice with my therapist, we took some time to discuss it. I was particularly happy with my wife‚Äôs response. My therapist pointed out that most of the things that I had been saying ‚ÄúOk!‚Äù to were **normal changes** that everyone navigates. The fact that my wife was blown away by my ‚Äúunprecedented response‚Äù was more of **an indication of how difficult it has been to live with OCD**.


## Lesson

While it felt like we were swinging the pendulum completely away from identifying how I felt and what I could give in the moment, the truth was that these two principles were in complete harmony. Part of what ‚ÄúOk!‚Äù unlocks for me is the ability to **slip past OCD** and **allow myself to do something normal** without the typical levels of irritation and resistance.

The goal is not to stop caring about everything. But if I can push myself to **actively accept more of the changes** that come up in my life, I can hopefully stop overcaring and overthinking about everything. 


## Challenge

Over the coming week, the challenge for me, and for you if you‚Äôll join me, is to **just say ‚ÄúOk!‚Äù more**. If there is a strong and important reason to say no, we won‚Äôt do it. But for most everything, let‚Äôs go with it. We‚Äôve got this.
