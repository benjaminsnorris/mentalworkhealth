I loved this article from the Art of Manliness: [Sunday Firesides: Marriage Isnâ€™t a Game of Russian Roulette](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-marriage-isnt-a-game-of-russian-roulette/)

> But rather than being the kind of unmanageable risk found in Russian roulette, the risk of marriage is more like that of driving a car. While you canâ€™t 100% eliminate the chance of a crash, nobody lets that stop them from getting behind the wheel every day. Because despite the risk, that mechanical vehicle, like the vehicle of marriage, will take you places you couldnâ€™t otherwise go.

We can allow risk to inhibit us, or we can allow it to help us. When we notice that something feels risky, instead of shutting down, we should recognize that this is something that is more important to us. We need to step up and engage fully and make sure that we meet the risk head on.
