My wife was reading a book with the 2yo sitting on her lap and another child next to her. She was reading loud enough that the other child could hear, and the 2yo covered his ears and whispered, “Too loud, Mom!”

My wife would get quieter and kept reading. After a couple minutes, her voice would get louder until he would again cover his ears and whisper, “Too loud!”

This happened a few times before they finally finished the book and auditory balance was restored.
