I think that all humans are phasic to some degree or other. As a strange mix of emotion and logic, there are natural tensions that operate on us. We are wired to notice the new or unusual, and this has a real impact on our ability to focus on a task or project for an extended length of time. I have found that to be extremely true in myself. I will get excited about a new project and dive in with great passion. But after the novelty wears off, and I am distracted by something new, it is far too easy to let go of previous projects.

This has certainly been true with my blogging. I will go in phases where I am diligent about writing, and find it extremely beneficial. But, inevitably, new things come up. For me, those typically come in the form of new apps that I want to build. It is a real challenge to maintain consistency with a naturally long-term task like blogging.

At different times in my life, I have tried to fight this tendency with varying levels of success. There are certainly long-term commitments that need to not fade from priority or lose attention. Some of the most important for me are my wife and six kids. But not all projects needs to have that same level of persistence.

Lately, I have been thinking more about embracing the fact that my interests drift. Obviously there needs to be a balance so that crucial part of life are not abandoned. But it is really not a problem if I start on a project, and then move on to another one before finishing the first. Too often, I will stick with a project just because it was the plan, and not because it is still the priority. I want to get better at being flexible and adapting, and my personality pulls at me to do that already.

Moving forward, my philosophy will be to ride the wave a bit more. There is a natural ebb and flow to life, and it is ok to give myself permission to follow that. I need to occasionally take stock and make sure that my true priorities are not being neglected. But in my hobbies and side projects, I am allowing myself to dive in when I am passionate and back off when I am not. I will check back in after a few months and see what adjustments need to be made.
