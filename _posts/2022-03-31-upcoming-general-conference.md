This weekend is one I always eagerly anticipate. It will be [General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/learn/general-conference?lang=eng).

Typically I enjoy [sketchnoting the conference](https://bennorris.com/tags/general-conference/), but I have to travel this weekend and will miss most of it. I look forward to catching up next week.

If you could use some more peace in your life, I invite you to join in to hear uplifting messages about the Savior and how we can feel and spread His love.
