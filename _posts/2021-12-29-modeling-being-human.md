As a leader, one of the most important things you do for those who follow you is modeling. I have seen all too often leaders who work excessive hours while preaching the value of work/life balance.

This article by [David Sturt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsturt) at my company, [O.C. Tanner](https://www.octanner.com/), was a great reminder of the importance of time off: [The Business Case For The Holiday Recharge](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhsturt/2021/12/22/the-business-case-for-the-holiday-recharge/).

> Modern leaders also understand that the imperative to take a break starts at the top. 

I especially loved this reminder about the realities of being human at work:

> It used to be that leaders expected employees to bring their best selves to work, regardless of what was happening at home. Modern leaders understand that this isn’t realistic. We’re the same human beings at home as we are in the office.

Mental health is just as important at work as in any area of our lives. As we focus on ways to improve our own wellness, we help create space for those around us to do the same. This is kind and compassionate as humans. It is essential as a leader.
