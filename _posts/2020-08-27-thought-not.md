My 8yo came down with some coupons from a mailer to ask if I went to some of these places by myself, and if so, he would give me the coupons.

8yo: “Do you go to Popeyes?”

Me: “Yes.”

8yo: “Knew it. Here you go. Burger King?”

Me: “Nope.”

8yo: “Thought not. Arby’s?”

Me: “No.”

8yo: “I thought you’d go there. They have great cheese sticks. Or whatever they’re called.”
