This last week has been a great experience to take the challenge to [#GiveThanks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/the-story-behind-my-global-prayer-of-gratitude) every day leading up to Thanksgiving. Gratitude lifts and heals.

### [Day two](https://www.bennorris.com/2020/11/22/office-space)

> One thing I am grateful for today is that I found a great small office space to rent to start getting a little more separation between work and home. Looking forward to getting set up and having somewhere to go for work. [#GiveThanks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/the-story-behind-my-global-prayer-of-gratitude)

### [Day three](https://www.bennorris.com/2020/11/22/use-of-space)

> Today I am feeling grateful for my wife and her creative use of space. We have rearranged our small house and it is feeling great to have a quiet spot of our own amidst the chaos. [#GiveThanks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/the-story-behind-my-global-prayer-of-gratitude)

### [Day four](https://www.bennorris.com/2020/11/23/my-boss)

> Today, I feel grateful for my boss [Mel Tingey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meltingey). He is the best leader I have ever had, and is a fantastic support to me. I love working with him and continue to grow and develop as I do. [#GiveThanks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/the-story-behind-my-global-prayer-of-gratitude)

### [Day five](https://www.bennorris.com/2020/11/24/lego-harry-potter)

> Today, I’m feeling grateful for LEGO Harry Potter on the Nintendo Switch. 😆 It’s been a fun way to unwind lately and has good for my mental health. [#GiveThanks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/the-story-behind-my-global-prayer-of-gratitude)

### [Day six](https://www.bennorris.com/2020/11/25/a-job)

> I feel incredibly grateful for a job today, and especially the one I have with [O.C. Tanner](https://www.octanner.com). As all jobs are, it is hard at times and pushes me to stretch and grow. I get to be with great people and focus on improving the lives of people at work. 🥰 [#GiveThanks](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/the-story-behind-my-global-prayer-of-gratitude)

### [Day seven](https://www.bennorris.com/2020/11/26/my-family)
