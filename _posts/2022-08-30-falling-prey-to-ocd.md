I thought it might be helpful to share a recent [free writing](https://bennorris.com/tags/free-writing) entry. I had wanted to process my thoughts and feelings as OCD was starting to take over in my life. The realization that was happening struck me as I was writing my latest weekly update, [#95: Experimenting with discomfort](https://bennorris.com/2022/08/26/experimenting-with-discomfort).

[![Experimenting with discomfort](https://media.bennorris.com/images/mentalworkhealth/posts/experimenting-with-discomfort.jpg){:loading="lazy"}](https://bennorris.com/2022/08/26/experimenting-with-discomfort){:.clean}

I had written in that update,

> I decided that the general guideline is that **tracking for a clear purpose is ok**. Especially if my doctor asked me to.
> 
> However, if I’m tracking just to have the data, that’s where I should draw the line.

As I drove in to my office the day after writing that update, I knew that I needed to do some processing. Here is what I wrote.

> I realized yesterday as I was writing my update that **I was violating my rule for tracking**. I was tracking all sorts of things just for the data.
> 
> I want to stop.
> 
> And I want the data. But why? What do I want it for?
> 
> I know from experience that I don’t really use the data. And when I start tracking, it gives OCD a foothold into my life. In this case, it has snuck in and started to take over more.
> 
> Part of my brain was justifying, saying that it will be more accurate to have more data points, which will help me see and report to [my psychiatrist] better.
> 
> But the goal is not accuracy. **My fear is that I will do it wrong.** I won’t have the data that I want, and so I won’t be able to go back and look at things.
> 
> And **that might be true**. I need to lean in to the uncertainty.
> 
> I want to challenge myself to not go back and change past entries. And also, it would be helpful to compare the same things. So maybe I will.
> 
> But **I have spent way too long thinking about this**. I am inclined to say that I get to think through it as much as I want right now while I write. Then I get a few minutes to set up the system in a way that makes it easier to do moving forward, and then I’m done. After that, I only get to do a simple log at night. The goal is to use the app as little as possible while still getting the benefit.
> 
> So now, indulge.
> 
> **What do I want?** Well, the answer is to figure out what I want to do with the data and then determine what data I need in order to do that. [My psychiatrist] wants to **see trends**—are things better or worse? For that, I actually would benefit from logging less.
> 
> As it is right now, I find myself worrying about the accuracy. So I don’t put that a day was red if it also had some green in it. Fuck that. It’s a red day.
> 
> Then, we want to be able to **compare ranges** and know what we are comparing. So **it would be helpful to have inflection points or milestones**. The ones that I want to have are appointments with him and med changes. That is probably enough for comparing.
> 
> Finally (I think), it would be nice to **have some help saying what different days looks like**. What was a red day? What was a yellow day? So I would like to have something to just describe quickly what went down. Basically, I want to record **something about my symptoms**.
> 
> And **that’s it**. I don’t want to record other activities I am doing. I don’t want to correlate with my sleep, or eating, or drinking. When I start to do that is when OCD starts to take over.
> 
> So which symptoms will I track? Irritability is one. Agitation. Panic attack. Dissociation or something—when I’m not in my right brain. Rigidity. Something about communication—I want to capture days in which I can’t compute things. Not sure what to call that yet. Getting stuck on something mentally. Maybe that’s it? I don’t want to have too many. Maybe rumination, although that might be every day. But it’s worth considering.
> 
> My mind already went through the question of **whether to track wins** in here. And I think **no**. It’s enough to say wins equal higher mood and less symptoms.
> 
> **There is a strong part of me that wants to ask [my therapist] about this and get instructions or the proper procedure to do this right.** I noticed a strong urge for that this morning, driving in. That is part of what tipped me off that this had become an issue.
> 
> I know. **Trust myself.** Call myself out and ask earnest questions. That’s usually all it takes.
