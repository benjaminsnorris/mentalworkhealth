Last April, I <a href="https://bennorris.com/2012/04/05/lds-general-conference" title="LDS General Conference April 2012">posted</a> my sketchnotes from <a href="http://www.lds.org/general-conference/about-general-conference" title="LDS General Conference" target="_blank">LDS General Conference</a> for the first time. This time around, I decided to not sketchnote during the actual conference. I decided that it had the tendency to make me irritable when one of our four young kids would talk to me or interrupt me in some way. I was too stressed about capturing the talks.

The answer to my dilemma also came from my experience last conference. Because I do Romanian interpretation for some of the sessions, I listed to and <a href="https://bennorris.com/2012/05/14/lds-general-conference" title="LDS General Conference April 2012 Part II">sketchnoted those sessions</a> after the fact. This conference I decided to take that approach with every session.

So this is the Saturday morning session; the first in a five-part series as I capture each session and post it here. Hope you enjoy it!
