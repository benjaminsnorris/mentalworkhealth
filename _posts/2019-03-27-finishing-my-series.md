💮 I finished my series “What mental illness feels like” today, and posted an [updated conclusion](https://www.bennorris.com/2019/03/18/what-mental-illness-feels-like#conclusion). This has been my best writing—maybe not the most well-written, but the most vulnerable and therapeutic. I hope it helps others face the horror of mental illness with less fear.
