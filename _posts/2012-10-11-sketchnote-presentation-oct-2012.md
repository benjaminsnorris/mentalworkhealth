I was thrilled to have the opportunity to present on sketchnotes at the annual <a href="https://bennorris.com/2012/10/11/sort" title="SORTÂ 2012">SORT conference</a>. I have had the chance to present on sketchnotes across the country, and found that the same question seemed to come up every time, "How do I get started?" In this presentation, I lay out what sketchnotes are, why they are so valuable, when and where you can use them, how to do them, and who can do them. There is even a hidden bonus on how to draw stick figures! I thoroughly enjoyed creating and delivering this presentation, and hope that it could help a few more people dive into the blissful world of sketchnotes.
