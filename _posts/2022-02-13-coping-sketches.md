What a difference a couple hours makes. After getting up this morning, I started having a panic attack. I put some ice on the back of my neck and reset enough to sit down and try to process what I was feeling.

I tried out my alternate version of the [Mindful Sketch Template](https://bennorris.com/mindful-sketch-template/) that I created yesterday. It was perfect because I didn’t have to be capable of enough thought to identify emotions on my own. It was just a recognition task.

After I had processed through the emergency moment, I was able to plan my day out. Then I thought I could do my regular mindful sketch practice.

This was my first time doing an emergency exercise followed by my daily practice. It was a great success. Now I’ll go change a poopy diaper.
