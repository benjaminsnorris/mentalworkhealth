My 2yo was drinking out of his cup as I got him ready for bed, and as he finished it, I asked, “Would you like more water?”

2yo: “There is no more water. It all gone.”

Me: “Would you like me to get you more?”

2yo: “Oh, yes. Can you put some from yours into here?”

I poured some more water in and went to put his lid on, but he stopped me, “Will you not put the lid on? It’s not for right now.”

As he started drinking, he said, “Oh, I love Dr. Pepper.”

Me: “Yeah, it’s so good.”

2yo: “This cold Dr. Pepper ‘minds me. I love cold Dr. Pepper.”
