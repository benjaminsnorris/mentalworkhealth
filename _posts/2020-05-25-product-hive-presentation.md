I was thrilled to join with the rest of my product team at work to share a case study of our process operating within constraints.

***

In my day job, I am an engineering manager and get to work closely with my product teamâ€”our product manager, our UX designer, and me. We recently gave a joint presentation on working within constraints, and how we have approached things with our current project. I am extremely fortunate to work with talented and capable people, and it was delightful to prepare and deliver together.
