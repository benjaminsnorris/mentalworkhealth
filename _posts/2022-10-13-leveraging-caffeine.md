Part of the journey to figuring out a good rescue med has been understanding all of the options I have to deal with my OCD and its accompanying symptoms.

My therapist is of the opinion that just like depression and anxiety, ADHD can be a manifestation or symptom of OCD. That doesnâ€™t mean that everyone who has ADHD also has OCD, but rather that having OCD typically includes having ADHD.

Itâ€™s a classic logic equation: if A then B does not mean if B then A.

This makes a lot a sense when you think about what these diagnoses are. In an effort to create an understandable shorthand, we take a group of symptoms and call them a disorder. In this case, OCD is something of a [superset](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of the symptoms of ADHD. Poor impulse control? Constant need for stimulation? Tendency to hyperfixate? Check, check, check.

I bring all that up because one of the unofficial tests for ADHD is the effect of caffeine. If you can drink a caffeinated soda and it settles you down instead of ramping you up, even to where you can immediately go to sleep, that is an indicator that you might have ADHD.

A few weeks ago, I took my three oldest kids to Disneyland, as I wrote about in [update #99: Canâ€™t get in](https://bennorris.com/2022/09/23/cant-get-in).

One of the days we were there, I started feeling my agitation and anxiety levels rise. I realized that even though I had found [a good rescue med that works](https://bennorris.com/2022/10/11/a-rescue-med-that-works), I had forgotten to bring them to the park with me.

I remembered something my therapist had told me that works for her and ordered a Coke. I sent her a message a little while after I finished it.

> Just experienced what you described with a Coke. Was feeling super agitated and had one for lunch and am now relaxed.

It was a great little moment for me to remember and reinforce that I am not powerless when my body and mind stop cooperating. I have options.

I shared last week how I have been changing medications and I was telling my therapist how afraid I was to have nothing: [Tapering off everything](https://bennorris.com/2022/10/07/tapering-off-everything).

My therapist reminded me that going to have nothing. Having [a good rescue med](https://bennorris.com/2022/10/11/a-rescue-med-that-works) makes a huge difference. And remembering my experience with the Coke, I joked that I would also have Dr. Pepper (which everyone knows is far superior to Coke).

> I love that. Xanax and Dr. Pepper. Sounds like a great plan.

The second part of that plan is important because I need to be careful to not take Xanax too often. So Iâ€™m trying to ride the line of using it for emergencies and letting Dr. Pepper fill in the gaps. Itâ€™s an imprecise science, to be sure.
