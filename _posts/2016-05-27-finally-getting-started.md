excerpt:        After putting this off far too long, I’m finally blogging.

Back in January of 2016, I had a discussion with my manager and made some goals for the year. One of my main goals was to start blogging. I have been heads down on coding for the past year and a half, and had always meant to start recording some of thoughts and contributing back to the community, but just hadn’t started yet.

Part of me felt that I needed to gain more experience and learn more that was actually worthy of being shared. But then I noticed that many of the people that I was following, and that I respected most, were sharing concepts that they were just trying out, or that they were wanting to learn. I was especially inspired by [Natasha The Robot](https://www.natashatherobot.com), and her bite-sized posts that clearly explained different things she was figuring out.

As I continued to try new things out, and learn more about the craft of creating iOS apps, I started compiling a list of blog topics. Over the next few months, I hope to get in a habit of capturing my process, my goals, and my learnings along the way. At the very least, I will start building a repository of knowledge for myself to easily refer back to when I forget something that I have learned. Hopefully the things that I learn and that I share will be valuable to others as well.
