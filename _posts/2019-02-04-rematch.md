As I [posted this morning](https://www.bennorris.com/2019/02/04/right-vs-left), I played a racquetball match against myself on Saturday. This morning, I had a rematch.

Again, I thought I would just share the text chain:

> Me: Early lead for right hand. First game 11-7. It was closer than the score made it sound though.
> 
> Wife: I believe in you, left hand
> 
> Me: Holy smokes. Revenge of the left hand. 11-1. And it was up 9-0!
> 
> Wife: [Gif of Dwight yelling "Yes, yes, yes!"]
> 
> Me: And he pulls it out! Left hand in the third 11-9 to win the match. Boom!
> 
> Me: And now Iâ€™m sweating like crazy. Tough loss.
> 
> Me: ðŸ˜…
> 
> Wife: Way to METABOLIZE
> 
> Me: Thatâ€™s right babe!!

So, yeah, it was pretty epic.
