Itâ€™s ok that Iâ€™m not that funny. Just because Iâ€™ve listened to comedians on THWoD doesnâ€™t mean I have to be one.

***

Iâ€™ve mentioned a few times, and will again, that my current favorite podcast is [The Hilarious World of Depression](http://hilariousworld.org). Many of the guests have been comedians and have talked about dealing with their mental health through comedy.

The more I listened to comedians grappling with their mental health, the more I thought I should become a comedian too. I even told my wife that was my new life planâ€”to do stand-up comedy. It seemed like the logical next step. There was only one problem.

Iâ€™m not that funny.

I can get some laughs occasionally. I teach at a programming boot camp, and I often say something that is funny enough for the students to laugh. And that feeling! When I say something that connects with people, something inside me is filled I didnâ€™t know was empty.

At the same time, I recognize that I am not naturally funny. My wife is, however. Without much effort, she says and writes things that make people laugh. As a child, I was never particularly funny. I knew people who were, but I was never comfortable enough with myself for that kind of attention.

This doesnâ€™t mean I wonâ€™t ever try stand-up. Iâ€™m intrigued by improv. There seem to be many associated benefits, and it is scary enough that I think I should give it a go.

The key has been coming to terms with myself as I am now and being content with that. I donâ€™t have to reinvent myself. I also donâ€™t need to hold myself back from exploring desires or dreams that I have. If I want to pursue comedy, I can. But I donâ€™t have to in order to be happy with who I am. I am valuable just as I am right now.
