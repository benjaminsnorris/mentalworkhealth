As I wrote about [last month](https://bennorris.com/2018/08/14/ui-tdd-with-xcode), I was able to speak at Cocoaheads on some work we have been doing with Xcode UI Testing. I am speaking again tonight at a different Cocoaheads group, which is exciting for me.
I had created a sample project for my presentation last month, but lost the project when my computer died and had to get the logic board replaced. I have recreated the sample project, and am happy to share it here:

And just in case you would like to download the slides for reference, here is a link to the PDF:
