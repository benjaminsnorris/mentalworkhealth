Our 3yo has been talking about "his friends" often lately. His friends do basically everything he thinks is cool.

Today, we learned the name of at least one of his friends: Jumpy Pants.

Apparently, Jumpy Pants makes double layered sandwiches. 

Also, Jumpy Pants has a trampoline. And it is not broken and has no holes in it and the zipper works.

Jumpy Pants has a pretty great life.
