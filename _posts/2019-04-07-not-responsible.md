![You are not responsible for other peopleâ€™s feelings](https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2019/04/Other-Peoples-Feelings-Header-2.jpg){:loading="lazy"}

I loved this article from the Art of Manliness: [Sunday Firesides: You Are Not Responsible for Other Peopleâ€™s Feelings](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sunday-firesides-you-are-not-responsible-for-other-peoples-feelings/)

> But when your decision doesnâ€™t carry moral import, and you make it with all the politeness and respect possible, then youâ€™re not responsible for how the other person deals with your choice. Whether they deal with it resiliently or not, rationally or not, generously or not, is up to them. You cannot control their reaction. And you cannot make your own decisions based on their expected response.

Coming to terms with unnecessary and unhealthy guilt has been a huge part of my mental health recovery process. It is vital to learn how to correctly identify your areas of responsibility and neither shirk nor stretch them.
